# LCA-Disclosure
This is a multi-class classification problem. Labor condition application (LCA), is a document that a prospective H-1B employer files when it seeks to employ nonimmigrant workers at a specific job occupation. In this Analysis, we are trying to predict the case status of an application submitted by the employer to hire non-immigrant workers under H1-B visa program.
